# admissions
how you decide which hackers to admit to your event

# a note on software
this admissions stack is done basically entirely in microsoft excel. a full web app was an option, but too time consuming; slackbots and such are options but have significant deployment costs on your end. excel allows three sheets to take care of all calculation functionality, including:
1. normalization for reader bias - some readers have higher or lower averages, or higher or lower variance
2. demographic separation - you can admit hackers with customized gender or racial breakdowns, and view your breakdowns for each method you employ

# a note on diversity
all of these tools are optimized to allow you to admit hackers with any criteria you choose (up to 5), and in any gender or racial breakdown you choose (or with no specifications). this is because of the personal bias of the creator - i believe that hackathons are fundamentally a learning experience and fundamentally about hackers and the community.
