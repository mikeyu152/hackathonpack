partnering to help hackers build meaningful projects

## why partner with nonprofits?
there's been a growing movement towards hackathons with a "social good" component, whether that be a vertical or a central event theme. this makes a lot of sense - it seems like hackathons thus far have focused on the act of making, and less on the impact of the projects. while this has its merits, it also seems that current hackathons have built a lot of hacks that aren't pursued in the long run, and the movement towards "social good projects" seems to be a movement to reverse that; partnering with nonprofits ensures that somebody somewhere will find a use for some of the hacks.

## how does one set up these projects?
there are two big pieces of advice here for organizers looking to get nonprofits and projects involved with their hackathon.

#### one: start early

nonprofits are hard to close. while sponsors necessarily have a recruiting department, and typically, tech companies will have some kind of protocol to sponsor, no such system is in place at most nonprofits, at least at time of writing. as the ecosystem grows, this may become less true, but as it currently stands, nonprofits seem less likely to respond to a given email, take longer to respond on average, and are less likely to be interested.

#### two: be ready to co-create

not all nonprofits, especially those that aren't tech-focused or located in the bay area, have a pipeline of technical projects they're just waiting for somebody to come work on. in fact, most probably don't. similarly, even those that do don't necessarily have projects your hackers are interested in working on or that will be directly impactful - updating or redesigning a website is not exactly why most people go to hackathons. accordingly, i've found that the best thing to do is reach out to nonprofits, and offer your feedback on their projects and how they can better interest hackers and define their problems in such a way that hackers will be able to make meaningful progress. while it's important that you let the nonprofit figure out what their problems and pain points are, you (hopefully) bring a solid understanding of the technology that exists today, the scope of hackathon projects, and how these things can help solve some of the nonprofit's problems.
