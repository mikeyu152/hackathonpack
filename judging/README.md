allocating prizes and all that fun stuff

## how important is judging?
hackers seem to want to move away from competition, at least if social media is to be believed. "hacking should be done for hacking's sake" is not a totally crazy or out-there belief. however, if your hackathon has prizes (which it probably does)

#### getting judges

generally, it seems sub-optimal to have a lot of your organizing team judge. your organizing team isn't necessarily the best equipped to judge a hackathon, and is very likely to be running around fighting fires (metaphorically!) during expo and closing ceremony. 

#### two: be ready to co-create

not all nonprofits, especially those that aren't tech-focused or located in the bay area, have a pipeline of technical projects they're just waiting for somebody to come work on. in fact, most probably don't. similarly, even those that do don't necessarily have projects your hackers are interested in working on or that will be directly impactful - updating or redesigning a website is not exactly why most people go to hackathons. accordingly, i've found that the best thing to do is reach out to nonprofits, and offer your feedback on their projects and how they can better interest hackers and define their problems in such a way that hackers will be able to make meaningful progress. while it's important that you let the nonprofit figure out what their problems and pain points are, you (hopefully) bring a solid understanding of the technology that exists today, the scope of hackathon projects, and how these things can help solve some of the nonprofit's problems.
