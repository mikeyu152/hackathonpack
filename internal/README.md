how you take care of your organizing team

## communication

it feels almost as if every hackathon organizing team is already on **[slack](http://slack.com)**. there's a reason for this, and if your team isn't on slack, you'll want to get your team on.

## collaboration

your team should get on some kind of collaboration software as well, whether that be **[google drive](http://drive.google.com)**, **[quip](http://quip.com)**, or something else. 

i also strongly recommend **[airtable](http://airtable.com)** for spreadsheet-esque collaboration. a lot of the useful data for your event (more than you'd think) is best represented in sheet form, and it has some cool tools (such as attachments and slack integration) to make it even more useful. check out their **[conference planning template](https://airtable.com/templates/event-planning/conference-planning)** for ideas and also just as a great template to use.
