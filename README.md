organizing a hackathon: a hackpack

## preface
a hackpack is a package of starter code that serves as, [per treehacks](https://medium.com/@hackwithtrees/treehacks-the-redux-7f4e50feb8ba#.vkw9kbdkj), a tool for hackers to "help you skip the drudgery and get straight to your dreams." this is an attempt to do similar for organizers. when it comes to hackathons, too many events suffer because a lot of time is spent on the menial work - the mechanics of admissions, money, or logistics, for instance - and organizers don't have time to plan the "non-essentials," like extra experiences or great ceremonies, to take their events to the next level.

this is a guide, and more importantly, "software" stack + suggested softwares, to help you do the easy stuff more efficiently.

(almost) all of this has been "battle-tested" by organizing teams, and we'd love to see organizing teams who have processes for their hackathons contribute as well. hundreds of hackathons are run across the country - it seems that every hackathon could gain a lot if we all shared our methods, best practices, and tools.

## how to use
each folder (the complete list of folders is available in the index section below) has a README, which explains the various tools included. some tools (admissions in particular) require a pretty stringent process to remain clean and easy to use - if this is the case, it'll be detailed in the README.

this should go without saying, but use whichever modules you have a need for/you feel will work well for you. each folder is independent and can be used as such.

sometimes the README will link to software that has been open-sourced by a hackathon vs. something that was contributed directly to this hackpack - everything that is linked to will be open-source, though.

## section index

### admissions

1. hackathonAppReading - a tool process copy/pasted typeform data and use searches to read apps
2. hackathonAppScoring - a tool to record hackerID-score tuples and have them automatically normalized for reader bias
3. hackathonAppProcessing - a tool to aggregate copy/pasted normalized scores from 2. and use some configurations to pick admits
4. README - explains the above 3 in greater depth, and adds:
  1. Hackathon Application Template - a typeform with some examples and pointers for setting up a Typeform application
